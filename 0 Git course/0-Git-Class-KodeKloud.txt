git status

- to find out if we are on the branch master
- are there any commits?
- are there any untracked files?
- was there anything added to commit but untracked files present?

#put it in the staging area
git add <file>

#commit our change
git commit -m "Added first story"

#show changes to be committed
git status

#introduce yourself to GIT
git config user.name "sarah"
git config user.email "sarah@examples.com"

#open a text editor. This is where you type a message. Save and close. It will commit. 
git commit 

cat story1.txt
line1

echo "line2" >> story1.txt

cat story1.txt
line1
line2

git status

git restore store1.txt
cat story1.txt
git status
(nothing to commit)

- if we add new files and modify the store1.txt file we have 2 commits to make.
- use 'git add .' to stage them all.

git add . 

git status
(ready to commit)

git commit -m "Added second story and updated first story"

- only files in the staging area are committed. That's why the staging area is SO important.
- so add the file to the staging area
git add story1.txt

- and commit to repository
git commit -m "Committing story1.txt"

- and now we can add the story2.txt file to the Staging area and commit it.
git add story2.txt

git commit -m "Committing story2.txt"

git status

It's important to make each commit individual, because each commit should be a single problem that's being resolved. This way we can keep a clean history, as multiple developers would be working on bugs and features.

- How do you remove a file from the staging area?

git restore --staged file.txt

If we have files we want git to ignore we can use the following command:

echo "notes.txt" >> .gitignore

1)
What is a command to initialize a git repository?
git init

2)
Initialize a git repository at /home/sarah/story-blog
Create directory if it doesn't already exist.

sarah $ sudo mkdir /home/sarah/story-blog
mkdir: can't create directory '/home/sarah/story-blog': File exists
sarah $ sudo git init /home/sarah/story-blog
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /home/sarah/story-blog/.git/


3)
Which hidden folder gets created after initializing a git repository?

Explore the repository created in the previous step

.git

4)
Let's test some of the concepts we learned so far in our lectures.

Which area of a local Git repository contains files with active (uncommitted) changes immediately after initializing the repository?

The working area!!!!!

5)
Let’s add a file to our project inside /home/sarah/story-blog

File name: lion-and-mouse.txt
File content: A Lion lay asleep in the forest

sarah $ sudo git init /home/sarah/story-blog
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /home/sarah/story-blog/.git/
sarah $ sudo touch lion-and-mouse.txt > home/sarah/story-blog
bash: home/sarah/story-blog: No such file or directory
sarah $ sudo touch /home/sarah/story-blog/lion-and-mouse.txt
sarah $ vi lion-and-mouse.txt 
sarah $ cat lion-and-mouse.txt 
A Lion lay asleep in the forest

6)
In Git, which stage contains changes that are ready to be committed to the local repository?
Note: This refers to files that have been added with git add but not yet committed.

The Staging area.

7)
Now that a text file has been added, let us verify whether git has detected the changes made. Although no operations have been performed with git yet, we have initialized a git repository within this project, meaning git is aware of all our files and their changes.

To assess the status of git, please execute the git status command.

Based on the output of the git status command, please answer the following questions.


8)
What commits are listed in the git repository?

No commits.


9)
What's the status of the lion-and-mouse.txt file in the repository?

Untracked file.


10)
Which area of the local git repository is the lion-and-mouse.txt file in ?

Still in the working area!


11)
Stage the file lion-and-mouse.txt to make it available for commit.

git add lion-and-mouse.txt
git status

12)
Now, it's time to commit our change! A commit records the change in the repository compared to its previous state.

Before making your first commit, you need to configure the Git user to record who is making the commit.

Set the Git username to sarah and the user email to sarah@example.com using the following commands:
git config user.email sarah@example.com
git config user.name sarah


13)
Now that your file is staged, it's time to make your first commit in this repository. This commit will record the addition of the lion-and-mouse.txt file in the repository history.

First, check the status of your repository using:
git status

Then, commit the staged file with the commit message: Added the lion and mouse story using the command:
git commit

sarah $ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   lion-and-mouse.txt

sarah $ git commit -m "Added the lion and mouse story"
[master (root-commit) c37a738] Added the lion and mouse story
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 lion-and-mouse.txt
 

14)
 Sarah created a new file named notes.txt where she plans to write down ideas about the story for personal purposes. She does not want git to track this file or share it with her team mates.

What is the current status of the notes.txt file?
sarah (master)$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        notes.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

15)
It is good that the file is untracked. But it is still under GIT's radar. If you run the "git add ." command accidentally git will start to track this file.

Let's configure git to ignore this file permanently.

echo "notes.txt" >> .gitignore

16)
What's the status of the file notes.txt now in the git status command's output.
Not listed at all.

17)
As you might have noticed the .gitignore file itself may be listed as untracked. It is a good practice to track the .gitignore file with git.

18)
Let's explore another git repository. We have a repository used for the development of an application cloned at /home/sarah/learning-app-ecommerce.

Identify the state of the git repository. How many files are staged and how many are not?

1 Staged and 1 Modified.

You need to make two separate commits in your repository:

    Commit the README.md file
        Use the commit message: Add instructions for verification
        Note: README.md is already staged, so you can commit it directly.

    Commit the js/theme.js file
        Use the commit message: Increase time from 400 to 500
        Note: This file is not staged yet, so you need to add and commit it in one step.


sarah (master)$ git commit -m "Add instructions for verification"

20)
Check which files or folders this repository is set to ignore in Git.

Note: You can view the .gitignore file in the repository to find the list of files and directories Git is configured to ignore.

sarah (master)$ cat .gitignore
.DS_Store
.idea/


21)
.idea/ is a directory created by the IntelliJ Idea IDE. These are personal to the user and we don't want these to be checked in to the git repository along with our code.

An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud.

The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.

Here's a fun one! Looking at the commit history of all branches, what's the best graphical representation of the branches in this repository?
Checkout each branch and then use the command git log --graph --decorate to see previous branch.

GIT Merging branches

- once the feature has been fully tested, only then we can merge the feature branch into the master branch

- if we want to merge a branch we'd first need to checkout to the master branch if we are going to merge the feature/signup into the master branch

git checkout master

git merge feature/signup


Fast-forward vs. no-fast-forward!!!!
A fast-forward happens when the branch being merged is directly ahead of the branch you’re merging into — that is, there’s a linear path from the current commit to the target commit (no divergent commits).
If no new commits have been added to main since branching off, merging feature into main can be done simply by moving the branch pointer forward:
git checkout main
git merge feature

No merge commit created — Git just updates main to point to commit E.

Key traits:

Linear history (no extra merge commit)

Happens when the base of feature equals the tip of main

Equivalent to: git merge --ff

A no-fast-forward occurs when both branches have diverged — meaning both have new commits since the split point. Git needs to create a new merge commit to combine them.
Now, merging feature into main:
git checkout main
git merge feature

Merge commit (M) created — it ties together both branch histories.

commit 3fbd0b18d03ef8f44da7afad7197d43389a1cff0
Author: sarah <sarah@example.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 12 10:07:22 2025 +0000

    Added the lion and mouse story
	
	
2)
What's the name of the story in the master branch?

The Lion and the Mouse.

3)
How many branches does the repository currently have?
2

4)
The new story Sarah wrote is in the story/frogs-and-ox branch. It's time to merge the branch and bring it to the master branch.
But before that look at the log of the master and story/frogs-and-ox branches and identify how many commits there have been in the past on each branch.

Master 2, Frogs-and-ox 3.


5)
Correct! First sarah committed the 🦁 Lion and Mouse 🐭 story in the master branch and then created a new branch for the 🐸 Frogs and ox 🐂 story, then went back and fixed typo in the 🦁 Lion and Mouse 🐭 story and then went back and finished the 🐸 Frogs and ox 🐂 story.
Next we will merge the new story into the master to have all stories in the master branch.

6)
While in the master branch merge the story/frogs-and-ox branch. If prompted for a commit message leave it to the default and quit the editor.
sarah (master)$ git merge story/frogs-and-ox
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 frogs-and-ox.txt | 19 +++++++++++++++++++
 1 file changed, 19 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 frogs-and-ox.txt
 
7)
Check the log of the master branch and see how many commits are seen now
5

8)
Git merged all the commits we made in the story/frogs-and-ox branch to the master branch. But since we made an additional commit on the master (fixing the typo from LIOON to LION) git created a new merge commit.

9)
List the files in the master branch and make sure both the stories are visible.

Initialize Remote Repositories <-------------------------------------------------

The most common:
Github
Gitlab
BitBucket

We get access to a Connection String, which is the location of the repository!

git remote add origin
(a name for the remote and can have multiple remotes)
- 'origin' becomes the alias, so we don't have to remember the entire connection string. 

Full command:
git remote add origin http://..../.../name.git

- display all remote repositories
git remote -v

- we can 'push' and 'fetch' data to and from the remote repo from our local drive. 

########################

Pushing to remote repositories <------------------------

- we're pushing data from our local drive/repo to the remote repo.

git push origin master

Great going Sarah 👏 ! So far Sarah has been working by herself in her own local repository on her laptop. It's time to share her work with the team. Let's push the code to the remote git repository.


4)
Github is awesome! But for the purpose of our lab exercises we will be using the Gitea platform. It is a lighter version of Github. However a lot of basic functions are the same. So it should suffice our needs for practice.

You may access the Gitea web portal by clicking on the Git Portal UI link at the top of your terminal


5)
No one in Sarah's team has created a remote repository yet for this project. So Sarah decides to create one so everyone in the team can collaborate. Let's now create a remote git repository named story-blog in Gitea using the GUI. Click on Git Portal UI to access the UI, login with the below details and create a new repository.

UI login info:

Username: sarah

Password: Sarah_pass123

Repository Name: story-blog

Keep other options default when creating repo

CREATED!!!!!


6)
From within the lab environment (terminal) the remote repository is accessible at the URL http://git.example.com. Let's now configure the remote repository for the local repository at /home/sarah/story-blog

Target remote repo URL : http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git

remote repo alias : origin

Note: This URL won't be accessible from your personal laptop as it is only available within the lab environment.

sarah (master)$ git remote add origin http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git
sarah (master)$ git remote -v
origin  http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git (fetch)
origin  http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git (push)


7)
Which command can be used to push data to our remote repo?
remote repo alias : origin
remote branch : master

git push origin master


8)
Now push our current stories to the remote git repository we created

Lab: Cloning Remote repositories <---------------------------

Do the best you can. No one can do more than that.

– John Wooden

1)
Max would like to contribute to the story blog. Let's help Max share(push) his story to the remote repository created by Sarah.

2)
First max needs to download the current code (stories) uploaded by Sarah in remote repository. As user Max, clone the remote repo to his home directory - /home/max
Target repo web URL : http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog
You can also find this URL from UI

git clone http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog

3)
Check the contents of the cloned repository. Confirm that you can see Sarah's story and history of commit by running git log and validate author info, commit message etc.

4)
Max has written his story about The 🦊 Fox and Grapes 🍇
View the file he created and its contents. You may read the story if you wish to. But don't spend all day 😝


5)
Let us now try to commit the changes. Try to commit the changes with the message Added fox-and-grapes story. And you might get an error that says Please tell me who you are

This is because Max has cloned the repository, but Git doesn't know who Max is. Max needs to tell Git his username and email address. For this use the command git config user.email "max@example.com" and git config user.name "max"

max (master)$ ls
fox-and-grapes.txt  frogs-and-ox.txt    lion-and-mouse.txt
max (master)$ git add fox-and-grapes.txt 
max (master)$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   fox-and-grapes.txt

max (master)$ git commit -m "Added fox-and-grapes story"
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'max@dev01.(none)')
max (master)$ git config user.email "max@example.com"
max (master)$ git config user.name "max"
max (master)$ git commit -m "Added fox-and-grapes story"
[master f1f7e55] Added fox-and-grapes story
 1 file changed, 21 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 fox-and-grapes.txt
max (master)$ 

6)
Great! It's time to push our changes to remote. Do we need to add a remote repository, as Sarah did, before pushing?
Check the configured remotes on the repository

Run the git remote -v command to check the remote repository

Remote clones are always created as we clone the repository.


7)
Now try to push Max's story to remote git repository hosted on Gitea using the below details. If you might run into a permission denied error, proceed to next question.

login info:
Username: max
Password: Max_pass123
remote repo alias : origin
remote branch : master


8)
If you ran into an issue it is because the repository is public but not everyone can change it. It is public but read-only. To push changes to the repository you need to be a collaborator or a member of the project.

The account owner - Sarah needs to add you as a collaborator. While logged in to the Gitea UI as user sarah go to Settings -> Collaborators of the project and add max as collaborate with Write permissions.

Use Sarah's credentials:
Username: sarah
Password: Sarah_pass123


DONE


9)
Now try to push Max's story to remote git repository hosted on Gitea

In the previous lab we got Max to push his changes to the remote repository. But he pushed them to the master branch directly. We don't want people to do that.

The master branch is the final version of the story. It should always only have content that has been reviewed and approved. We cannot just allow everyone to directly push to the master branch. So let's do it the right way this time.

In the previous labs we got Max to push his changes to the remote repository. The remote repository now has the 2 stories contributed by Sarah and the one contributed by Max.

Sarah's local repository does not have the new story pushed by Max. Let's update our local repository to be in sync with the remote.

There are 2 ways to go about this. The first approach is to Fetch the remote branch and Merge it.
From the local repository Fetch the information about the changes in the remote.

Hint:
Run 'git checkout master; git fetch origin master' to fetch remote changes

sarah (master)$ git checkout master; git fetch origin master
Already on 'master'
From http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

3)
To view all the branches- both local and remote - run the git branch -a command.

The remote branches have the prefix remotes


4)
Now that we’ve fetched the origin master branch, we can update our local master branch with the latest changes made on origin/master branch.
Merge the remote master branch to local master

Syntax: git merge <other-branch>

Run git merge origin/master


5)
Max just pushed another story to remote. Let's retrieve that using the second approach. Use git pull origin master to pull all remote changes.


sarah (master)$ git pull origin master

Great! What's the name of the new story added by Max?

Check your local repository

The Donkey and the Dog.

DONE!!!

GIT - Merge Conflicts

- we're trying to merge 2 files between Max and Sarah that are similar. 
- Git detects a merge conflict.
- But Git will add extra characters to the file that's conflicting.

- we can remove the lines in the file that we don't want to keep and save the file.

git add fourth_story.txt
git merge

###########
Lab: Merge Conflicts <-------------

1)
Max and Sarah have been contributing stories. And they are available on the remote repository.
Max's local repository has all the latest changes from the remote and is in sync with it. Check it out!
Note: You can Login to git UI with sarah user and password: Sarah_pass123


2)
During a meeting the team decides to add an Index file to the repository named story-index.txt which would contain a list of all stories written.

It wasn't clear who would own this task, so Max decides to do it himself 💪 . He creates a file named story-index.txt and adds a list of stories to it. Check it out under the /home/max/story-blog directory.


3)
Let's now stage and commit the story-index.txt file.
Use the message - Add index of stories

Hint:Run git add story-index.txt; git commit -am 'Add index of stories'

max (master)$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
max (master)$ ls
fox-and-grapes.txt  frogs-and-ox.txt    lion-and-mouse.txt  story-index.txt
max (master)$ git add story-index.txt 
max (master)$ git commit -m "Add index of stories"
[master b4ffe26] Add index of stories
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 story-index.txt



4)
Let's now push the file to the remote repository.
Try with the git push origin master command, and select the response you get

Hint: Run the command git push origin master. It should fail with the rejected message.

max (master)$ git push origin master
To http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git'

What was the result of the Pull operation?
Read the last 2 lines of the output of the git pull command.

Merge Conflict.


8)
We are now in a merge conflict 🙅‍♂️ ! Looks like there was already a file named story-index.txt on remote. Someone beat us to it! Let's find out who.

Check the log of the origin/master branch to see what was the last commit on the repository and identify who added the story-index.txt file.

Hint: Run git log origin/master.

max (master)$ git log origin/master

Looks like Sarah already pushed a version of the file. When we pulled latest changes, git tried to merge Max's and Sarah's versions of the story-index.txt file, but was unsuccessful. However the local story-index.txt file is updated with changes from both Max and Sarah to allow you to merge manually.

Inspect the file (use vi editor or just cat story-index.txt) and select the most appropriate statement below. The first section shows Max's data and the second section shows Sarah's data.

max (master)$ cat story-index.txt 
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. The Lion and the Mooose
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog
=======
1. The Lion and the Mouse
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
>>>>>>> af43d20f56835f8ecea8ced61e931020628873a5

Sarah missed the Donkey and Dog story.


10)
Looks like both of them were partially wrong. Let's fix the file to remove the errors done by each of them. Let's manually merge changes from both users.

Update the contents of the file (use vi editor) to keep the correct version of the Lion and Mouse story and keep the Donkey and Dog story as well. Remove all the extra lines added by GIT.

max (master)$ cat story-index.txt 
1. The Lion and the Mouse
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog


11)
Now that we have made a change, we must now commit it.
Commit the current changes with the message - Resolved merge conflicts and merged story index.

Run the command 'git commit -am 'Resolved merge conflicts and merged story index''.

max (master)$ git commit -am 'Resolved merge conflicts and merged story index'
[master 50a25a2] Resolved merge conflicts and merged story index

12)
Now that we have merged the changes, everything's clean ✨ . We can now push the changes to remote.

Hint:Run the command 'git push origin master'. It should now go through without an issue.

Sarah has been working on a new story The Hare and Tortoise for a while now, in the branch story/hare-and-tortoise
Explore the local repository at /home/sarah/story-blog

sarah $ cd story-blog/

Great! Now our local master branch has many more commits. Sarah would like to update her working branch - story/hare-and-tortoise - branch with the latest updates.
Sarah is especially looking for the story-index.txt file so that she can update her story to it the clean way and not end up in a merge conflict as it did previously.

OK


5)
But before we do that, let's check the current status. Check out the story/hare-and-tortoise branch and inspect the files in it.
How many commits do you see in the current branch?

Hint:
Run the command git log --oneline.

6)
Let's rebase the story/hare-and-tortoise branch on top of master.
    - Checkout the story/hare-and-tortoise branch first and then rebase master.
    - Run the command git rebase master

Run the git rebase master command

sarah (master)$ git checkout story/hare-and-tortoise
Switched to branch 'story/hare-and-tortoise'
sarah (story/hare-and-tortoise)$ git rebase master
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/story/hare-and-tortoise.
sarah (story/hare-and-tortoise)$ 


7)
Awesome! Check the stories and the index file now. It should be up to date with all changes and the git log command should now include the commits from the others users as well.

8)
Sarah continues to update her story. Check the new commits on story/hare-and-tortoise.

9)
However she does not want multiple commits for the same story. She would like to squash all the commits into a single commit.

Run the command git rebase -i HEAD~3 to squash the last 3 commits into 1.

In the editor that opens, leave the first line as is, and change the second and third lines to use squash instead of pick. Then save the file. This way we pick the first commit and then squash the second and third commits to it.

In the next editor window that opens set the commit message to Add hare-and-tortoise story and save it.

Hint:
Run: git rebase -i HEAD~3 command after that it will open with the default editor. Change the second and third lines to use squash instead of pick.
In next, add new commit message Add hare-and-tortoise story and save it.
To see the changes run the git log --oneline command.

Lab: Cherry picking

1)
In the previous lab Sarah pulled all the changes pushed by her team and then rebased her branch to stay up to date with the changes.
We have rewinded the lab to the state right before the rebase. Check the contents of the story-index.txt file.

2)
However, what she was really looking for was only the story-index.txt file on her working branch story/hare-and-tortoise. She does not really want the stories written by her team in her working branch.
She only needs certain commits that were made to update the story-index.txt file. For this we can simply do a Cherry pick 🍒


3)
First identify the hash of the last commit that updated the story index file in the master branch.

Hint:
Run the git log master --oneline command and get the first 4 lines of the commit hash next to the commit named Updated the story index file.

sarah (story/hare-and-tortoise)$ git log --oneline
5f0527a (HEAD -> story/hare-and-tortoise) Add first draft of hare-and-tortoise story

On the working branch, cherry pick the commit with the hash identified in the previous step. If you end up in merge conflict, merge the file manually and make sure to leave the latest contents in the story-index.txt file.
Run the command git cherry-pick < commit hash you identified in previous step >

Hint:
First Run: git checkout story/hare-and-tortoise to switch to the working branch.
Next, use the cherry pick command git cherry-pick < commit hash you identified in previous step >


sarah (master)$ git cherry-pick 54bc6b7
On branch master
You are currently cherry-picking commit 54bc6b7.
  (all conflicts fixed: run "git cherry-pick --continue")
  (use "git cherry-pick --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git cherry-pick --abort" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
The previous cherry-pick is now empty, possibly due to conflict resolution.
If you wish to commit it anyway, use:

    git commit --allow-empty

Otherwise, please use 'git cherry-pick --skip'
sarah (master)$ cd story/hare-and-tortoise
bash: cd: story/hare-and-tortoise: No such file or directory

The publisher informs that the author details need not be added within the story. Instead it would be displayed next to the story on the web page. As such it needs to be removed from within stories 🤦‍♀️
All the changes Sarah made needs to be undone 😩. Help Sarah undo all the changes made in the previous commit. Note that the changes must be retained in the commit history. Use the default revert commit message.

Hint:
Use git revert HEAD~0 command or git revert <commit id>

sarah (master)$ git revert HEAD~0

Sarah has been adding additional content to the Hare and Tortoise story. She accidentally commits the current version before actually finishing the story.

Help Sarah revert the last commit but retain the unfinished changes so that she can continue to finish her story. The last commit must not be part of the GIT history.

Hint:
Use git reset --soft HEAD~1 command.

sarah (master)$ ls
fox-and-grapes.txt     frogs-and-ox.txt       hare-and-tortoise.txt  lion-and-mouse.txt     wolf-and-goat.txt
sarah (master)$ git reset --soft HEAD~1

Sarah has now completed her story 😊. Commit the current version of the story with the message 'Finish hare-and-tortoise story'.

Hint:
Use git commit -am 'Finish hare-and-tortoise story' command.

sarah (master)$ git commit -am 'Finish hare-and-tortoise story'

She takes a short break, and then reads through the new version of her story. But she does not like it 😕. The old version was so much better.

She is so embarrassed 😦 with the new version that she does not want it to be in the commit history at all. Help Sarah reset her story to the previous good version of the story and remove all commits and changes she made since the commit Finish hare-and-tortoise story.

Hint:
Run git reset --hard HEAD~3

sarah (master)$ git reset --hard HEAD~3
HEAD is now at 6f12c87 Finish hare-and-tortoise story
