git branch "descriptive-greetings"
git status
git branch
git checkout descriptive-greetings
git branch 
(now "descriptive-greetings" is in green)

git status
(nothing to commit)

ls

vi greetings.py

git status
git add greetings.py
git commit -m "added motivation phrase"

ls
vi moon_flight.py
(add some text)

git status
(moon_flight.py added)
git add moon_flight.py
git commit -m "added moon flight file and functionality"

(push the changes back to the master)
git push origin master
(Everything is up-to-date)
git push origin descriptive-greetings
(this will push everything from your local git branch to GitHub)

You will notice that moon_flight.py is not part of the master branch and that's because we worked under the "descriptive-greetings" branch. 
Browse to the "descriptive-greetings" branch and notice that the files in there, are in their own branch, but not part of the "master" branch.

Branching is an important concept of Git/GitHub.
